# YouTube Shorts Hider

A simple, lightweight Chrome extension to hide YouTube Shorts for a more focused browsing experience.

## Features

- **Declutter Your Feed:** Automatically hides the "Shorts" shelves and any individual Shorts videos from your homepage, subscriptions, and recommendations.
- **Works Dynamically:** Hides new Shorts as you scroll down the page, without needing to refresh.
- **Easy to Toggle:** A simple click on the extension icon in your browser toolbar lets you turn the hiding on or off.
- **Remembers Your Choice:** Your preference is saved, so you don't have to re-configure it every time you open YouTube.

## Installation

### From the Chrome Web Store (Recommended)

*(Coming Soon!)*

### Manual Installation (for Developers)

1.  **Download the Code:** Download the project files and unzip them into a folder on your computer.
2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:** In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle in the top-right corner.
4.  **Load the Extension:** Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder where you unzipped the files.

## Usage

1.  Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
2.  Click the "Show Shorts" or "Hide Shorts" button to toggle the visibility of Shorts on YouTube.

## How It Works

The extension adds a small stylesheet to YouTube pages. When "Hide Shorts" is active, this stylesheet tells your browser not to display the elements that make up YouTube Shorts. This is a fast and efficient way to clean up your feed without slowing down your browsing.
